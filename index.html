        International Day to also be utilized in order to promote humane conditions of imprisonment, raise awareness
        about prisoners being a contionous part of society, and to value the work of prison staff as a social service of
        particular importance. <br> General Assembly resolution <u>A/RES/70/175</u> not only adopted the revised United Nations Stnadard
        Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, but also approved that they should be known as <strong>"Nelson
            Mandela Rules"</strong> in order to honour the legacy of the late President of South Africa, who spent 27
        years in prison in the course of his struggle referred to above.
